VPC endpoints for S3 are secured through VPC endpoint access polices.This allows you to set which S3 buckets the endpoints should and should not have access to.
By default, any user or service within the VPC, has access to any S3 resource.
Use together with S3 bucket policies to further refine access control over your buckets and objects.
