 The visibility timeout begins when Amazon SQS returns a message.During this time, the consumer processes and deletes the message.
 However, if the consumer fails before deleting the message and your system doesn't call the DeleteMessage action for that message
 before the visibility timeout expires, the message becomes visible to other consumers and the message is received again.
 If a message must be received only once, your consumer should delete it within the duration of the visibility timeout.

 keyword: SQS queue writes to an Amazon RDS From this, Option D best suite & other Options ruled out
 [Option A-You can't intruduce one more Queue in the existing one; Option B-only Permission & Option C-Only Retrieves Messages]
 FIF O queues are designed to never introduce duplicate messages.However, your message producer might introduce duplicates in certain scenarios:
 for example, if the producer sends a message, does not receive a response, and then resends the same message.
 Amazon SQS APIs provide deduplication functionality that prevents your message producer from sending duplicates.
 Any duplicates introduced by the message producer are removed within a 5-minute deduplication interval.
 For standard queues, you might occasionally receive a duplicate copy of a message (at-least-once delivery).
 If you use a standard queue, 
 you must design your applications to be idempotent 
 (that is, they must not be affected adversely when processing the same message more than once).
